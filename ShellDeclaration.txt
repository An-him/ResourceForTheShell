I NEVER copy any code, 
I never look at solution (and never give any solution to your friends, you are not helping them by doing so)
I ALWAYS write code alone from scratch after you get help to check that you have actually understood. If you can not do it, you have not understood enough, and need to study more.
I DO NOT rewrite code from memory, but from understanding.

"I, Muhanguzi Michael Muhwezi, solemnly declare that I will uphold the principles of honesty and integrity in my approach to learning and using code. I will never engage in plagiarism, copy code, or look at solutions to solve coding challenges. Instead, I am committed to understanding the underlying concepts and writing code from scratch to ensure that I have truly comprehended the material. If I find myself unable to do so, I will take it as a sign that I need to further study and improve my understanding. This commitment is a testament to my dedication to the field of programming and my pursuit of knowledge and skill development."
